        <Typography>
            The game plays over 5 rounds corresponding to 5 caves. Inside a cave each round consists of each player
            deciding to either advance further into the cave or return to camp.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>The game has a deck of cards which contains treasure cards, trap cards and relic cards.</Typography>

                    <b>Treasure card</b>: The card corresponds to some number of points. Share them equally with all
                    players still in the cave. The remaining points are left on the ground. Points you gather during the
                    expedition can be lost. The points are added to your point total when you return to camp.

                <Typography>
                    <b>Trap card</b>: If a trap appears for the first time since you entered the cave, nothing happens
                    and the expedition continues. However, if the same trap is revealed a second time, all players in
                    the cave immediately return to camp empty handed. The expedition ends immediately.

                <Typography>
                    <b>Relic card</b>: The relic card stays in the cave and nothing happens. The card isnâ€™t worth any
                    points until a player leaves the cave alone.

        <Typography variant="h6">2. Voting</Typography>
        <Typography>
            Each player still in the cave must decide to continue into the cave, or return to camp to actually get the
            points from the expedition. Players vote by pressing either the <b>Stay</b> button or the <b>Leave</b>{' '}
            button. When everyone is ready, the votes are revealed.
        </Typography>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <Typography>
                    <b>Stay</b>: Advance into the cave to get more treasure.
                </Typography>
            </li>
            <li>
                <Typography>
                    <b>Leave</b>: Return to camp:
                </Typography>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <Typography>The points from the expedition are added to your point total.</Typography>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Typography>
                            If leaving alone you receive all the points left on the ground. If multiple players are
                            leaving at the same time, they equally share all the points. If there are any points left
                            after this, they are left on the ground.
                        </Typography>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Typography>
                            If multiple players leave at the same time, no one takes the relic cards. However, if only
                            one player leaves, they take all relics in the cave. The relics are removed from the game
                            and the player receives the corresponding amount of points.

        <Typography>If some players are still in the cave, a new card is revealed.</Typography>

        <Typography variant="h6">3. End of a round</Typography>
        <Typography>
            An expedition ends when all players return to camp or when the same trap appears twice in the cave. Continue
            to the next round:
        </Typography>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <Typography>
                    The second identical trap card from the game is removed from the game if the expedition triggered
                    that trap.

        <Typography variant="h5">End of the game</Typography>
        <Typography>
            The game ends when the players finish exploring the 5th cave. The player with the most points wins. On a
